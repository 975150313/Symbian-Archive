# Introduction

This small website was created to collect and organize tools and documentation relative to Symbian OS. All those files were collected after the official website shutdown.

There are still a lot of missing files and tools. If you have anything that could be helpful don't hesitate to contact me by creating an issue in the [github repository](https://github.com/mrRosset/Symbian-Archive/).

# What is missing

## SDKs

While not complete, the s60 series SDKs are well garnished. What is missing the most right now are the SDKs for the s80, s90 and UIQ series. Apart from a single java one for the s90, none of them are currently saved and organized here.

For Symbian Belle, S^3 some SDKs have been found but are not yet organized in the SDKs page.

Some more exotic SDKs are still missing, all of the python ones and some of the Qt.

## Documentation

A lot of whitepapers published on the nokia website and a lot of Developer Forum Guides are not saved yet. Worse it's actually a lot harder to know what is missing, since no complete list is available to my knowledge.

## Modding Tools

This is a collection of community created modding tools. Due to the disparition of the Symbian forums and of Symbian-related websites in general. This collection tries to store the maximum number of useful tools.

I'm not really sure how to cleanly organize the tools here in a comprehensive way. So until I figure this out here is [a link](https://mega.nz/#F!ml02EAjK!N9AlbkZ9qxCoSKnMxKIQeQ) to the Mega folder with all the tools in it. If you have any suggestion please open an issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/mrRosset/Symbian-Archive/).
